# Milovice Life RP — 4.8 Connected Town / Architecture

**Hra:** https://foxey-cz.github.io/milovice-life-rp/

Browser-based singleplayer RP prototype using real OpenStreetMap footprints of Milovice and official ČÚZK terrain. **Not** yet a photorealistic digital twin or an exact reconstruction of every house. Some regional buildings have mapped heights; untagged buildings use archetype-based approximations.

## 4.8 map expansion & graphics

- Five independently streamed OSM sectors: **Mladá, Benátecká Vrutice, Západní propojení, Mladá–Staré Milovice–Boží Dar, Boží Dar**. The older central extract remains the first sector.
- True local streets, service roads, rails and OSM building outlines. Data downloads are deduplicated by OSM way IDs in overlapping sectors.
- Matching **ČÚZK DMR 4G** regional elevation grids with 20 m gameplay sampling; old center retains more detailed 10 m DEM.
- The spawn vehicle menu now contains a **district selector**. As the player drives, adjacent regions are loaded progressively; citywide traffic gets new routes.
- Panel apartment blocks tagged 4–16 floors retain their height and receive photo-inspired facade styles, long balcony arrays, slab seams and entrance canopies. Houses, garages, schools, commercial and industrial buildings get different procedural facade treatment.
- Railway station model no longer uses one towering solid polygon. It has a raised central section, two low side wings, separate pitched red roofs and an open through-passage. Precise openings/roof dimensions remain *photo-informed approximations*.
- Graphics selector includes lightweight **balanced** mode and **realistic shadows** mode with localized PCF shadow casting; the latter can reduce FPS on phones.
- No photographs or Google Street View tiles are used as textures without suitable permission; only original procedurally generated game textures are embedded.

The area sectors are expanded **gameplay map windows**, not authoritative municipal boundary polygons. Additional distant countryside and exact landmark geometry remain incomplete.


## Earlier 4.7 mapped landmarks

| Place / feature | Geodata | Work done |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full-sized map | Game-simulated location, not phone GPS | Blue live player arrow, recenter, nearby landmark pins |
| Milovice railway station | OSM way 53865956 | Two physical open portico faces in station ground floor, arches, a platform canopy, station sign |
| Milovická Nádražka | Located in station building | Small cafe facade, serving window, courtyard seating; exact storefront wall inferred |
| Station shop | Reported by local player | Provisional shop frontage, exact tenant and physical face not yet verified |
| Modrá hvězda | Mírová 134/11, OSM way 202367194 | 2-floor photo-matched ochre/orange facade, red ground floor, white trim and balcony |
| Mírová 243/36 | OSM way 202367254 | Cream plaster, deep red roof, dormers, corner shop |
| Potraviny D a Š | Mírová 74/4, OSM way 202298645 | Verified address; provisional grocery facade |
| Cyklověž Milovice | OSM way 1011197691 | Tall faceted translucent glass/metal circular biketower |
| Church of St. Catherine | OSM way 118487991 | Neo-Gothic clock tower and spire |
| ZŠ T. G. Masaryka | OSM way 118487979 | School facade with signage |

See [architecture data & references](data/architecture-references.json), including photo author, historical date, license and model uncertainty. Many OSM building levels are missing or outdated. The new building heights remain **photo-derived estimates**, not survey measurements.

## Game
Controls: WASD/arrows to walk or drive; E to board/leave; C camera; R reset; M minimap; J jobs. Also supports mobile touch controls. Spawn picker offers a regional location (including the Mladá and Boží Dar areas), plus walking, sedan, SUV, van, police car and bus. Only an **active bus job** shows doors, passengers and route markers.

## Sources and attribution

## Quality checks
GitHub Actions validates JavaScript and runs a real Chromium WebGL smoke test on the 3D world, terrain, player/map marker, vehicle entry and bus job, including a two-opening station passage check. Repeated facade details are built with shared instanced geometry to reduce draw calls.

## Further work
Verify station shop, passage dimensions and each house level/roof against up-to-date photographs or survey; expand the geographic area after the center becomes recognizable.
